		          	<h3 class="bold"> Overview</h3>
		          	<p class="fontType justified">Supercomputing or High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms are used to power discoveries and to reduce the time-to-results in a wide variety of disciplines (such as, astrophysics, archaeology, and financial trading). For optimally utilizing these high-end platforms, it is critical to have scalable and efficient software (applications, middleware, libraries, and tools) that can take advantage of the innovative hardware features in these platforms. However, developing and maintaining HPC software remains a challenging task because the HPC platforms for which they are developed typically have a short life-span, and are replaced with next generation platforms within a few years. As we progress towards the exascale computing era, the task of developing and maintaining HPC software is likely to become even more challenging than now due to the increasing complexity of the HPC platforms and the pressing need for power-efficiency and memory usage optimization. There is a potential of mitigating some of the challenges related to developing HPC software for the current and future generation systems by adopting the innovations in the advanced software engineering sub-disciplines, such as model-driven engineering, generative programming, and adaptive and reflective software systems.</p>
								<br/>
		          	<p class="fontType justified">The goals of the first workshop on “Software Challenges to Exascale Computing” are to foster international collaborations across the HPC and the advanced software engineering disciplines, and to exchange knowledge on the challenges and solution strategies for developing scalable and efficient HPC software. The workshop attendees will learn about the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in the areas of HPC software development and advanced software engineering through presentations, hands-on sessions, and open-discussion sessions. Those already skilled in the advanced software engineering discipline will learn about the challenges and opportunities in the HPC domain, and can find interesting test cases for generalizing their innovative approaches.</p>
		            </div>
		            <div class="col-md-6">
		            <h3 class="bold remove"> Overview</h3>
		            <p class="fontType justified">The workshop will provide a forum through which hardware vendors and software developers can communicate with each other and influence the architecture of the next generation supercomputing systems and the supporting software stack. By fostering cross-disciplinary associations, the workshop will serve as a stepping stone towards innovations in the future. <br/><br />
		          	Benefits to the researchers and users in the academia: disseminate your results to the public, and find potential collaborators. <br /> <br />
								Benefits to software developers: understand the future trends in the HPC hardware and develop collaborations in the code modernization and optimization disciplines.<br /> <br />
								Benefits to HPC service providers: understand the challenges that the community faces in using the HPC platforms efficiently, and connect with the user-community. <br /><br />
								Benefits to HPC hardware vendors: understand the evolving needs of the HPC community, and network with potential customers.<br /><br />
								Benefits to students: network with HPC and advanced software engineering professionals and researchers, learn about internship and career opportunities, discuss the opportunities for higher education.

																<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>Today, high-performance computing (HPC) application codes are often optimized and specialized for a particular system configuration to exploit the system's potential. One severe problem is that simply modifying an HPC application code often results in degrading the performance portability, readability, and maintainability of the code. Therefore, we have been developing a code transformation framework, Xevolver, so that users can easily define their own code transformation	rules for individual cases, in order to express how each application	code should be changed to achieve high performance. In this talk, I will briefly review the Xevolver framework and introduce some case studies to discuss the benefits of the user-defined code transformation approach.<br />

												<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>Clouds play a very important role in modulating climate by controlling radiation received at the Earth surface. In spite of their importance, their dynamics are not well understood due to simulation limitations. The lack of understanding of the hydrodynamics and the micro-physical processes in clouds causes major uncertainties in current atmospheric general circulation models. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is a three dimensional simulation approach to simulate turbulent flows at smallest scale where the equations are solved explicitly without any approximation. Running the DNS in bigger domain is compute intensive and lengthy. Hence, prior knowledge of the resources required to run DNS code can be of great advantage. A Numerical Simulation of entrainment and mixing process at cloud interface to study droplet dynamics has been carried out for smaller domains and the time to run code for bigger domain has been projected using linear regression formula. Projected time for bigger domain size will provide researcher to estimate the wall clock time as well as storage requirement, based on available computational resources, to run DNS. The simulation is carried out for different size domains and optimized number of cores has been suggested based on scaling factors for different domains. Further a 17% gain in computational time is achieved by amending algorithm, where only sparse operations are considered in place of full dense data. Use of pnetcdf library has also provided advantages over conventional I/O format.</li>

																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Manu Awasthi, <i>"DRAM Organization Aware OS Page Allocation"</i></span></li>


																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>The applications in HPC and datacenter domains are beginning to have increasingly larger memory footprints running into multiple tens of gigabytes. Contemporary HPC server also have multiple NUMA nodes and the NUMA factor is increasing at an alarming pace with the increase in number of NUMA nodes. As a result, the average cost of main memory access has also been increasing. Furthermore, for a typical HPC application, DRAM access latencies are a function of 1) the memory allocation policies of OS (across NUMA nodes) and 2) data layout in DRAM DIMMs (per-NUMA node).<br /><br />

																										A DRAM DIMM has a hierarchical structure where it is divided into ranks, banks, rows and columns. There are multiple such DIMMs on each channel and there could be multiple channels emanating from one memory controller. Furthermore, there could be multiple memory controllers per NUMA node. Data layout across DRAM DIMMs and channels is a function of memory controller specific policies like address mapping schemes, which potentially can differ between multiple controllers on the same node.<br /><br />

																										The OS allocates memory at the granularity of pages. Since the OS has no knowledge of the underlying architecture and organization of per-NUMA node DRAM, each OS page could potentially be concentrated to a subset of available channels, DIMMs, ranks, banks and arrays, putting them under pressure and reducing performance. In order to get most benefit out of existing architectures, it is necessary that the OS allocate memory (at page granularity) while being cognizant of the inner architecture and organization of per-NUMA node DRAM.<br /><br />

																										In this proposal, we propose mechanisms where the OS, in addition to reducing memory allocation for processes across NUMA nodes, also takes into account the organization of DRAM DIMMs (channels, ranks, banks, rows, columns etc.) for every memory controller. This will help the OS make page allocation decisions which maximize the use of available parallelism, increase locality and hence reduce overall memory access latency, decreasing application runtimes.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>GPU computing is emerging as an alternative to CPUs for throughput oriented applications because of their number of cores embedded on the same chip and speed-up in computing. GPUs provide general purpose computing using dedicated libraries such as CUDA (for NVIDIA cards, based on a SIMD architecture that makes it possible to handle a very large number of hardware threads concurrently, and can be used for various purposes. This paper explains customization of a well-known open source earthquake engineering application OpenSees on hybrid platform using GPU enabled open source libraries.<br /><br />

																	Available GPU enabled version of OpenSees provided by Xinzheng Lu, Linlin Xie (Tsinghua University, China) uses CulaS4 and CulaS5, which use the Cula library and currently supported on window’s platform. Both of these limits the usage of OpenSees as an open source platform. To overcome this, we have modified existing CuSPSolver to use only freely available CUSP library. Speed up improvement is achieved by diverting analysis component to GPU architecture<br /><br />

																	GPU enablement will help researchers and scientists to use this open-source platform for their research in structural and earthquake engineering domain using OpenSees. Also as there are minor changes required to be done in the input script and no great programming efforts required to run it using GPU enabled OpenSees, these modifications are very user friendly. Speedup around 2.14x is observed when tested with some examples. Different types of examples were studied to compare the results and it has been observed that performance will increases with increase in complexity of the problem. Nodal displacement results of one of the example were compared with CPU and GPU simulations which were matching. This validates the methodology used for GPU enablement. These modifications were also integrated in the mainstream of OpenSees code at Berkley and now available to all structural engineering community. All the study carried out is for single CPU and single GPU. There is lot of scope to extend this work for multi GPU, using other accelerators and using OpenCL.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract:</span>The future exascale systems are expected to have numerous heterogeneous computing resources in order to achieve computational performance against the energy consumption guidelines.  To harness these computing resources it is essential to have hybrid applications that can exploit a combination of CPU and other accelerators for execution. To optimally exploit the cluster performance offered by the heterogeneous architecture, it is necessary to schedule the application based on their exhibited characteristics. However, scheduling hybrid parallel applications is a challenging task as a single resource allocation algorithm should be able to handle multiple aspects of heterogeneity, application characteristics and accelerators’ capabilities while ensuring to achieve optimal resource utilization and good response time to all the jobs. We propose a novel resource allocation technique which makes an in-depth logical scheduling decision based on multiple criteria - characterisation of the hybrid applications, energy conservation, and network topology with resource proximity for allocation. The knowledge of prior job execution is used to self evolve the optimal resource selection mechanism. A unique enhancement has been added in the scheduler to circumvent long waiting time by dynamically adapting applications to alternate resource through re-targeting the device at runtime. This technique helps to reduced waiting time for getting the required resource, and hence improves the turnaround time for the user.  The resource allocator considers the challenges of exascale scenario and orchestrates a solution to help HPC users to get their applications executed with less waiting time with better efficiency, and assures effective resource utilization from the HPC resource administrator’s perspective.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>Tremendous data growth in exascale HPC applications will generate variety of
datasets. This will impose two important challenges on the storage I/O system i) efficiently
process large data sets, ii) improved fault tolerance. The exascale storage systems are
expected to be capable enough providing bandwidth guarantee and applying coding scheme
optimized for the type of data set.<br /><br />
Traditional RAID architecture in HPC storage system is being replaced with network coding
techniques to provide optimal fault tolerance for data. There exists variation in network
codes based on traditional erasure (reed-Solomon) with number of libraries
implementations, which notably differ in terms of complexity and implementation for
specific optimizations.<br /><br />
We propose an I/O subsystem to provide bandwidth guarantee along with optimized fault
tolerance for variety of HPC/big datasets. The proposed storage I/O subsystem consists of
software defined storage gateways and controller working along with filesystem MDS. We
propose an I/O caching mechanism with hierarchical storage structure embedded at storage
gateway. The designed caching policy will cache smaller files on faster storage drives (like
SSD’s) eliminating long access latency for smaller sized files. The storage gateways are
running with systematic erasure (RS) code, with preconfigured encoding-decoding
algorithms. At each gateway, network coding (erasure coding encode-decode) is performed
at multiple tiers with specified parameter. Geometric programming is used to calculate
parameters at each tier based on data demand. The proposed system provides bandwidth
guarantee with caching mechanism at hierarchical storage layers. Flexible erasure coding
provides optimized fault tolerance for variety of application datasets.<br /><br />
Future work will focus on design of flexible caching and replacement policy for real time
workload and an adaptive encode-decode algorithm for highly skewed data demand.

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract:</span>The role and need of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology in various geospatial applications is proved beyond the doubts as SAR can make available critical information about on the filed information with centimeter to millimeter accuracy. The science of processing such SAR data using the distributed computing resources is more than two decade old and as of now been broadly bolstered by worldwide HPC labs for example, ESA’s G-POD (Grid Processing on Demand), Peppers (A Performance Emphasized Production Environment for Remote Sensing), DLR distributed SAR data processing environment, Center for Earth Observation and Digital Earth (CEODE) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),..etc. This paper discusses the difficulties and issues of Geospatial application users who are working with multiple sets of voluminous temporal SAR data and brings out the importance of developing and deploying all-purpose HPC based infrastructure environment that can meet the expectations of application users. Specific situations which require simultaneous processing of different frequency, polarization and incidence angle SAR data using the distributed HPC resources and related requirements will be discussed. For example during the SAR raw data processing, the need and importance of simultaneous processing and extraction of different polarization images as well as in completing its related post processing tasks and mapping operations will be highlighted. When the same has to be done at a regional scale, mainly to simulate large scale disaster events with various multi-look factors as well as with different post processing filtering options the need of developing and deploying such real time solutions on an exascale computing environment can be well understood. As on date such large scale complex SAR application model supporting the above mentioned expectations is yet to be developed. In line to this this talk will brings out the importance of prototyping such HPC based SAR data processing environment which can support the complete application cycle of real time regional disaster management simulations and its related operations. Any such operational setup certainly needs effective coordination of worldwide space agencies as well as distributed HPC labs.</li>

																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>The weather forecasting has a major impact on the society. The meteorologists have been using the
numerical weather prediction models for the operation forecast for over several decades ever since
Richardson's attempt towards numerical models for weather prediction. The weather codes have
consumed a good portion of the computational power available in several supercomputing centers.
This has led to the need to improve the computational efficiency of the codes/models to achieve
better resolution moving towards the better accuracy of the forecasts. However, these large scale
computations are possible only at the expense of the huge energy budget due to the increasing
requirement of computational resources as well as the cooling infrastructure required to maintain
them. But with the energy budget fixed at 20 MW it is even more challenging as we are compelled
to move towards energy efficiency of the weather codes. We focus towards the spectral transform
method as case study for this talk. This method has been in use in NCAR and ECMWF for the
operational forecasts.<br /><br />

In this talk, we shall discuss the basics of numerical weather predictions and move towards the test
bed shallow water model to be solved by spectral transform method. The highlights of the approach

																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>Clouds play a very important role in modulating climate by controlling radiation received at the Earth surface. In spite of their importance, their dynamics are not well understood due to simulation limitations. The lack of understanding of the hydrodynamics and the micro-physical processes in clouds causes major uncertainties in current atmospheric general circulation models. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is a three dimensional simulation approach to simulate turbulent flows at smallest scale where the equations are solved explicitly without any approximation. Running the DNS in bigger domain is compute intensive and lengthy. Hence, prior knowledge of the resources required to run DNS code can be of great advantage. A Numerical Simulation of entrainment and mixing process at cloud interface to study droplet dynamics has been carried out for smaller domains and the time to run code for bigger domain has been projected using linear regression formula. Projected time for bigger domain size will provide researcher to estimate the wall clock time as well as storage requirement, based on available computational resources, to run DNS. The simulation is carried out for different size domains and optimized number of cores has been suggested based on scaling factors for different domains. Further a 17% gain in computational time is achieved by amending algorithm, where only sparse operations are considered in place of full dense data. Use of pnetcdf library has also provided advantages over conventional I/O format.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Manu Awasthi, <i>"DRAM Organization Aware OS Page Allocation"</i></span></li>


																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>The applications in HPC and datacenter domains are beginning to have increasingly larger memory footprints running into multiple tens of gigabytes. Contemporary HPC server also have multiple NUMA nodes and the NUMA factor is increasing at an alarming pace with the increase in number of NUMA nodes. As a result, the average cost of main memory access has also been increasing. Furthermore, for a typical HPC application, DRAM access latencies are a function of 1) the memory allocation policies of OS (across NUMA nodes) and 2) data layout in DRAM DIMMs (per-NUMA node).<br /><br />

																	A DRAM DIMM has a hierarchical structure where it is divided into ranks, banks, rows and columns. There are multiple such DIMMs on each channel and there could be multiple channels emanating from one memory controller. Furthermore, there could be multiple memory controllers per NUMA node. Data layout across DRAM DIMMs and channels is a function of memory controller specific policies like address mapping schemes, which potentially can differ between multiple controllers on the same node.<br /><br />

																	The OS allocates memory at the granularity of pages. Since the OS has no knowledge of the underlying architecture and organization of per-NUMA node DRAM, each OS page could potentially be concentrated to a subset of available channels, DIMMs, ranks, banks and arrays, putting them under pressure and reducing performance. In order to get most benefit out of existing architectures, it is necessary that the OS allocate memory (at page granularity) while being cognizant of the inner architecture and organization of per-NUMA node DRAM.<br /><br />

																	In this proposal, we propose mechanisms where the OS, in addition to reducing memory allocation for processes across NUMA nodes, also takes into account the organization of DRAM DIMMs (channels, ranks, banks, rows, columns etc.) for every memory controller. This will help the OS make page allocation decisions which maximize the use of available parallelism, increase locality and hence reduce overall memory access latency, decreasing application runtimes.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>GPU computing is emerging as an alternative to CPUs for throughput oriented applications because of their number of cores embedded on the same chip and speed-up in computing. GPUs provide general purpose computing using dedicated libraries such as CUDA (for NVIDIA cards, based on a SIMD architecture that makes it possible to handle a very large number of hardware threads concurrently, and can be used for various purposes. This paper explains customization of a well-known open source earthquake engineering application OpenSees on hybrid platform using GPU enabled open source libraries.<br /><br />

																	Available GPU enabled version of OpenSees provided by Xinzheng Lu, Linlin Xie (Tsinghua University, China) uses CulaS4 and CulaS5, which use the Cula library and currently supported on window’s platform. Both of these limits the usage of OpenSees as an open source platform. To overcome this, we have modified existing CuSPSolver to use only freely available CUSP library. Speed up improvement is achieved by diverting analysis component to GPU architecture<br /><br />

																	GPU enablement will help researchers and scientists to use this open-source platform for their research in structural and earthquake engineering domain using OpenSees. Also as there are minor changes required to be done in the input script and no great programming efforts required to run it using GPU enabled OpenSees, these modifications are very user friendly. Speedup around 2.14x is observed when tested with some examples. Different types of examples were studied to compare the results and it has been observed that performance will increases with increase in complexity of the problem. Nodal displacement results of one of the example were compared with CPU and GPU simulations which were matching. This validates the methodology used for GPU enablement. These modifications were also integrated in the mainstream of OpenSees code at Berkley and now available to all structural engineering community. All the study carried out is for single CPU and single GPU. There is lot of scope to extend this work for multi GPU, using other accelerators and using OpenCL.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract:</span>The future exascale systems are expected to have numerous heterogeneous computing resources in order to achieve computational performance against the energy consumption guidelines.  To harness these computing resources it is essential to have hybrid applications that can exploit a combination of CPU and other accelerators for execution. To optimally exploit the cluster performance offered by the heterogeneous architecture, it is necessary to schedule the application based on their exhibited characteristics. However, scheduling hybrid parallel applications is a challenging task as a single resource allocation algorithm should be able to handle multiple aspects of heterogeneity, application characteristics and accelerators’ capabilities while ensuring to achieve optimal resource utilization and good response time to all the jobs. We propose a novel resource allocation technique which makes an in-depth logical scheduling decision based on multiple criteria - characterisation of the hybrid applications, energy conservation, and network topology with resource proximity for allocation. The knowledge of prior job execution is used to self evolve the optimal resource selection mechanism. A unique enhancement has been added in the scheduler to circumvent long waiting time by dynamically adapting applications to alternate resource through re-targeting the device at runtime. This technique helps to reduced waiting time for getting the required resource, and hence improves the turnaround time for the user.  The resource allocator considers the challenges of exascale scenario and orchestrates a solution to help HPC users to get their applications executed with less waiting time with better efficiency, and assures effective resource utilization from the HPC resource administrator’s perspective.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>Tremendous data growth in exascale HPC applications will generate variety of
datasets. This will impose two important challenges on the storage I/O system i) efficiently
process large data sets, ii) improved fault tolerance. The exascale storage systems are
expected to be capable enough providing bandwidth guarantee and applying coding scheme
optimized for the type of data set.<br /><br />
Traditional RAID architecture in HPC storage system is being replaced with network coding
techniques to provide optimal fault tolerance for data. There exists variation in network
codes based on traditional erasure (reed-Solomon) with number of libraries
implementations, which notably differ in terms of complexity and implementation for
specific optimizations.<br /><br />
We propose an I/O subsystem to provide bandwidth guarantee along with optimized fault
tolerance for variety of HPC/big datasets. The proposed storage I/O subsystem consists of
software defined storage gateways and controller working along with filesystem MDS. We
propose an I/O caching mechanism with hierarchical storage structure embedded at storage
gateway. The designed caching policy will cache smaller files on faster storage drives (like
SSD’s) eliminating long access latency for smaller sized files. The storage gateways are
running with systematic erasure (RS) code, with preconfigured encoding-decoding
algorithms. At each gateway, network coding (erasure coding encode-decode) is performed
at multiple tiers with specified parameter. Geometric programming is used to calculate
parameters at each tier based on data demand. The proposed system provides bandwidth
guarantee with caching mechanism at hierarchical storage layers. Flexible erasure coding
provides optimized fault tolerance for variety of application datasets.<br /><br />
Future work will focus on design of flexible caching and replacement policy for real time
workload and an adaptive encode-decode algorithm for highly skewed data demand.

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract:</span>The role and need of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology in various geospatial applications is proved beyond the doubts as SAR can make available critical information about on the filed information with centimeter to millimeter accuracy. The science of processing such SAR data using the distributed computing resources is more than two decade old and as of now been broadly bolstered by worldwide HPC labs for example, ESA’s G-POD (Grid Processing on Demand), Peppers (A Performance Emphasized Production Environment for Remote Sensing), DLR distributed SAR data processing environment, Center for Earth Observation and Digital Earth (CEODE) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),..etc. This paper discusses the difficulties and issues of Geospatial application users who are working with multiple sets of voluminous temporal SAR data and brings out the importance of developing and deploying all-purpose HPC based infrastructure environment that can meet the expectations of application users. Specific situations which require simultaneous processing of different frequency, polarization and incidence angle SAR data using the distributed HPC resources and related requirements will be discussed. For example during the SAR raw data processing, the need and importance of simultaneous processing and extraction of different polarization images as well as in completing its related post processing tasks and mapping operations will be highlighted. When the same has to be done at a regional scale, mainly to simulate large scale disaster events with various multi-look factors as well as with different post processing filtering options the need of developing and deploying such real time solutions on an exascale computing environment can be well understood. As on date such large scale complex SAR application model supporting the above mentioned expectations is yet to be developed. In line to this this talk will brings out the importance of prototyping such HPC based SAR data processing environment which can support the complete application cycle of real time regional disaster management simulations and its related operations. Any such operational setup certainly needs effective coordination of worldwide space agencies as well as distributed HPC labs.</li>

																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>The weather forecasting has a major impact on the society. The meteorologists have been using the
numerical weather prediction models for the operation forecast for over several decades ever since
Richardson's attempt towards numerical models for weather prediction. The weather codes have
consumed a good portion of the computational power available in several supercomputing centers.
This has led to the need to improve the computational efficiency of the codes/models to achieve
better resolution moving towards the better accuracy of the forecasts. However, these large scale
computations are possible only at the expense of the huge energy budget due to the increasing
requirement of computational resources as well as the cooling infrastructure required to maintain
them. But with the energy budget fixed at 20 MW it is even more challenging as we are compelled
to move towards energy efficiency of the weather codes. We focus towards the spectral transform
method as case study for this talk. This method has been in use in NCAR and ECMWF for the
operational forecasts.<br /><br />

In this talk, we shall discuss the basics of numerical weather predictions and move towards the test
bed shallow water model to be solved by spectral transform method. The highlights of the approach
with regard to algorithm, its scalability and improvements leading to the reduction in the
computational complexity will be discussed. To conclude, some of the recent efforts on scaling up
the solver for shallow water equations are discussed along with the glimpse of the ongoing efforts in
the ESCAPE project. This talk is inspired by our project proposal on “Scalable algorithmic
approach to spectral transform method” to be pursued under NSM, India.</li>

			<h3 class="bold makeItCenter">CFA (Call For Abstracts)</h3>
			<br />
			<p class="fontType justified"> The SCEC workshop will include a track for lightning talks during which ten-minute talks will be presented in a sequence. The talks will provide a high-level overview of the topics that are aligned with the theme of the workshop. While the time allocated for the lightening talks may not be enough for presenting the fine details of the chosen topic, it could be enough for including key information that piques the interest of the audience for an engaging discussion after the talk. The abstract and slides of the talks will be published on the workshop website. There can be multiple authors on a submission but only one presenter is permitted for each lightning talk due to time-constraints.
<br/><br/><b>Guidelines for preparing the submission for the lightning talk are as follows:</b><br /><br />
In maximum 300 words, the abstract should answer the following questions on a topic that is relevant to the workshop:<br /></p>
<ul class="noList fontType justified">
<li><span class="bold">• What is the software challenge/problem that is being solved?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• Why is this challenge/problem important to the HPC and/or the advanced software engineering community?</li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, who will benefit from the software/approach?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, what is the novelty of the software/approach?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, how do the preliminary results compare to those of the related work?</span></li>
</ul><br />
<p class="fontType justified">A rough draft of the proposed presentation (up to 5 slides) should also be submitted along with the abstract.
The abstracts and the slides must be submitted in the PDF format through the submission system at the following URL: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scec17" target="_blank" class="submitPdf hideAgendaTitle-max399" title="Submit PDF">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scec17

</a></p>
<span class="abstract">*</span>Abstracts will not be accepted over email. Abstracts which are incomplete or received after the deadline will not be considered. The submission system will close on <b>November 20, 2017</b>.
	<p><br/><span class="bold fontType">Presentation guidelines:</p class="fontType">
Lightning talk presentations are limited to one per speaker. Co-authors are not included in this rule. A person can be a co-author on any number of abstracts.</p>
