															<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>Advanced cyberinfrastructure and the ability to perform large-scale simulations and accumulate massive amounts of data have revolutionized scientific and engineering disciplines. In this talk I will give an overview of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) that was launched by Executive Order (EO) 13702 in July 2015 to advance U.S. leadership in high performance computing (HPC). The NSCI is a whole-of-nation effort designed to create a cohesive, multi-agency strategic vision and Federal investment strategy, executed in collaboration with industry and academia, to maximize the benefits of HPC for the United States. I will then discuss NSF’s role in NSCI and present three cross-cutting software programs ranging from extreme scale parallelism to supporting robust, reliable and sustainable software that will support and advance sustained scientific innovation and discovery.

															<span class="bold"><br />Bio: </span>A veteran of High Performance Computing (HPC), Dr. Chaudhary has been actively participating in the science, business, government, and technology innovation frontiers of HPC for over two decades. His contributions range from heading research laboratories and holding executive management positions, to starting new technology ventures. He is currently a Program Director in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure at National Science Foundation. He is Empire Innovation Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Center for Computational Research at the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences at SUNY Buffalo, and the Director of the university’s Data Intensive Computing Initiative. He is also the co-founder of the Center for Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering.<br /><br />

														He cofounded Scalable Informatics, a leading provider of pragmatic, high performance software-defined storage and compute solutions to a wide range of markets, from financial and scientific computing to research and big data analytics. From 2010 to 2013, Dr. Chaudhary was the Chief Executive Officer of Computational Research Laboratories (CRL) where he grew the company globally to be an HPC cloud and solutions leader before selling it to Tata Consulting Services. Prior to this, as Senior Director of Advanced Development at Cradle Technologies, Inc., he was responsible for advanced programming tools for multi-processor chips. He was also the Chief Architect at Corio Inc., which had a successful IPO in June, 2000.<br /><br />

														Dr. Chaudhary’s research interests are in High Performance Computing and Applications to Science, Engineering, Biology, and Medicine; Big Data; Computer Assisted Diagnosis and Interventions; Medical Image Processing; Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems; and Spectrum Management. He has published approximately 200 papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences and has been the principal or co-principal investigator on over $28 million in research projects from government agencies and industry. Dr. Chaudhary was awarded the prestigious President of India Gold Medal in 1986 for securing the first rank amongst graduating students at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). He received the B.Tech. (Hons.) degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 1986 and a Ph.D. degree from The University of Texas at Austin in 1992.</p><br />

															<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>Today, high-performance computing (HPC) application codes are often optimized and specialized for a particular system configuration to exploit the system's potential. One severe problem is that simply modifying an HPC application code often results in degrading the performance portability, readability, and maintainability of the code. Therefore, we have been developing a code transformation framework, Xevolver, so that users can easily define their own code transformation	rules for individual cases, in order to express how each application	code should be changed to achieve high performance. In this talk, I will briefly review the Xevolver framework and introduce some case studies to discuss the benefits of the user-defined code transformation approach.<br />

															<span class="bold"><br />Bio: </span>Hiroyuki Takizawa is currently a professor of Cyberscience Center, Tohoku University. His research interests include performance-aware programming, high-performance computing systems and their applications. Since 2011, he is leading a research project, supported by JST CREST, to explore an effective way of assisting legacy HPC code migration to future-generation extreme-scale computing systems. He received the B.E. Degree in Mechanical Engineering, and the M.S. and Ph.D. Degrees in Information Sciences from Tohoku University in 1995, 1997 and 1999, respectively.

			<br />
			<p class="fontType justified"> The SCEC workshop will include a track for lightning talks during which ten-minute talks will be presented in a sequence. The talks will provide a high-level overview of the topics that are aligned with the theme of the workshop. While the time allocated for the lightening talks may not be enough for presenting the fine details of the chosen topic, it could be enough for including key information that piques the interest of the audience for an engaging discussion after the talk. The abstract and slides of the talks will be published on the workshop website. There can be multiple authors on a submission but only one presenter is permitted for each lightning talk due to time-constraints.
<br/><br/><b>Guidelines for preparing the submission for the lightning talk are as follows:</b><br /><br />
In maximum 300 words, the abstract should answer the following questions on a topic that is relevant to the workshop:<br /></p>
<ul class="noList fontType justified">
<li><span class="bold">• What is the software challenge/problem that is being solved?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• Why is this challenge/problem important to the HPC and/or the advanced software engineering community?</li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, who will benefit from the software/approach?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, what is the novelty of the software/approach?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, how do the preliminary results compare to those of the related work?</span></li>
</ul><br />
<p class="fontType justified">A rough draft of the proposed presentation (up to 5 slides) should also be submitted along with the abstract.
The abstracts and the slides must be submitted in the PDF format through the submission system at the following URL: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scec17" target="_blank" class="submitPdf" title="Submit PDF">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scec17
