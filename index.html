		          	<h3 class="bold"> Overview</h3>
		          	<p class="fontType justified">Supercomputing or High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms are used to power discoveries and to reduce the time-to-results in a wide variety of disciplines (such as, astrophysics, archaeology, and financial trading). For optimally utilizing these high-end platforms, it is critical to have scalable and efficient software (applications, middleware, libraries, and tools) that can take advantage of the innovative hardware features in these platforms. However, developing and maintaining HPC software remains a challenging task because the HPC platforms for which they are developed typically have a short life-span, and are replaced with next generation platforms within a few years. As we progress towards the exascale computing era, the task of developing and maintaining HPC software is likely to become even more challenging than now due to the increasing complexity of the HPC platforms and the pressing need for power-efficiency and memory usage optimization. There is a potential of mitigating some of the challenges related to developing HPC software for the current and future generation systems by adopting the innovations in the advanced software engineering sub-disciplines, such as model-driven engineering, generative programming, and adaptive and reflective software systems.</p>
								<br/>
		          	<p class="fontType justified">The goals of the first workshop on “Software Challenges to Exascale Computing” are to foster international collaborations across the HPC and the advanced software engineering disciplines, and to exchange knowledge on the challenges and solution strategies for developing scalable and efficient HPC software. The workshop attendees will learn about the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in the areas of HPC software development and advanced software engineering through presentations, hands-on sessions, and open-discussion sessions. Those already skilled in the advanced software engineering discipline will learn about the challenges and opportunities in the HPC domain, and can find interesting test cases for generalizing their innovative approaches.</p>
		            </div>
		            <div class="col-md-6">
		            <h3 class="bold remove"> Overview</h3>
		            <p class="fontType justified">The workshop will provide a forum through which hardware vendors and software developers can communicate with each other and influence the architecture of the next generation supercomputing systems and the supporting software stack. By fostering cross-disciplinary associations, the workshop will serve as a stepping stone towards innovations in the future. <br/><br />
		          	Benefits to the researchers and users in the academia: disseminate your results to the public, and find potential collaborators. <br /> <br />
								Benefits to software developers: understand the future trends in the HPC hardware and develop collaborations in the code modernization and optimization disciplines.<br /> <br />
								Benefits to HPC service providers: understand the challenges that the community faces in using the HPC platforms efficiently, and connect with the user-community. <br /><br />
								Benefits to HPC hardware vendors: understand the evolving needs of the HPC community, and network with potential customers.<br /><br />
								Benefits to students: network with HPC and advanced software engineering professionals and researchers, learn about internship and career opportunities, discuss the opportunities for higher education.

																<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>Today, high-performance computing (HPC) application codes are often optimized and specialized for a particular system configuration to exploit the system's potential. One severe problem is that simply modifying an HPC application code often results in degrading the performance portability, readability, and maintainability of the code. Therefore, we have been developing a code transformation framework, Xevolver, so that users can easily define their own code transformation	rules for individual cases, in order to express how each application	code should be changed to achieve high performance. In this talk, I will briefly review the Xevolver framework and introduce some case studies to discuss the benefits of the user-defined code transformation approach.<br />

														<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>As systems scale in size and complexity, reasoning about their properties and controlling their behavior requires complex simulations, which often involves multiple interacting co-simulators that must be deployed and configured on high performance computing resources. Increasingly, cloud platforms which may even be federated, offer cost-effective solutions to realize such deployments. However, researchers and practitioners alike often face a plethora of challenges stemming from the need for rapid provisioning/deprovisioning, ensuring reliability, defining strategies for autoscaling against changing workloads, handling resource unavailabilities, and exploiting modern features such as GPUs, FPGAs, and NUMA architectures to name a few, for which they generally tend to lack the expertise to overcome these challenges.

														<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>HPC has huge future scope for scientific applications, large data bases, AI/deep learning, business applications in financial industry, telecom (particularly 5G) etc. Unfortunately, present systems are serving the market with separate products, in a rather fragmented manner. Challenge is to create a "Unified Architecture" that will unify the user space, following a "Top-down" approach instead of “Bottom-up" approach which forces applications to try to fit their code to peculiarities of particular cpu's, accelerators, system architecture etc. Today's potential of HPC and silicon technology is grossly underutilized due to effort and time spent in tailoring parallel code to specific machines.    Incorporation of FPGA-based reconfigurability in general applications is getting delayed unnecessarily. If economic benefits based on what is eminently feasible technologically, are not delivered to the society quickly enough, it slows down investments in further technological enhancements. All HPC users will benefit from this in the long run. At the same time, we are focusing on how very complex code can be put  together in shorter time-span, and in such a way that investment in top-level code design is long-lived in face of  anticipated changes in successive generations of chips, interfaces etc. Due to vast scope, we will present only a broad overview and elaborate only on couple of aspects.  Improving programmer productivity by designing and writing parallel code at multiple levels of abstraction by providing more expressive notations, tools for transforming one level to the next is required. It is also necessary to do away with artificial boundary between hardware description languages and how far traditional compilers reach starting from high level languages. This will ensure more seamless utilization of FPGA-based re-configurability in the unified system architecture. Since hardware aspects are too complex, only one particular aspect related to GPU's will be covered.  Initially, we’ll be addressing application of optimization algorithms to economic modelling and telecom systems.<br />

			<h3 class="bold makeItCenter">CFA (Call For Abstracts)</h3>
			<br />
			<p class="fontType justified"> The SCEC workshop will include a track for lightning talks during which ten-minute talks will be presented in a sequence. The talks will provide a high-level overview of the topics that are aligned with the theme of the workshop. While the time allocated for the lightening talks may not be enough for presenting the fine details of the chosen topic, it could be enough for including key information that piques the interest of the audience for an engaging discussion after the talk. The abstract and slides of the talks will be published on the workshop website. There can be multiple authors on a submission but only one presenter is permitted for each lightning talk due to time-constraints.
<br/><br/><b>Guidelines for preparing the submission for the lightning talk are as follows:</b><br /><br />
In maximum 300 words, the abstract should answer the following questions on a topic that is relevant to the workshop:<br /></p>
<ul class="noList fontType justified">
<li><span class="bold">• What is the software challenge/problem that is being solved?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• Why is this challenge/problem important to the HPC and/or the advanced software engineering community?</li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, who will benefit from the software/approach?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, what is the novelty of the software/approach?</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">• If applicable, how do the preliminary results compare to those of the related work?</span></li>
</ul><br />
<p class="fontType justified">A rough draft of the proposed presentation (up to 5 slides) should also be submitted along with the abstract.
The abstracts and the slides must be submitted in the PDF format through the submission system at the following URL: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scec17" target="_blank" class="submitPdf hideAgendaTitle-max399" title="Submit PDF">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scec17

</a></p>
<span class="abstract">*</span>Abstracts will not be accepted over email. Abstracts which are incomplete or received after the deadline will not be considered. The submission system will close on <b>November 20, 2017</b>.
	<p><br/><span class="bold fontType">Presentation guidelines:</p class="fontType">
Lightning talk presentations are limited to one per speaker. Co-authors are not included in this rule. A person can be a co-author on any number of abstracts.</p>
